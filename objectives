The paywith.glass team objectives for the Odyssey 2019 Hackathon are:
1. The definition of the first Public REST API rules for the paywith.glass platform (v0.1)
2. The release of the initial documentation for this API
3. An example of the API in use via a demonstration of how a mobile application can make use of this API to communicate
with the platform.

================================================================================================================================

Section 1: The REST API
-----------------------

paywith.glass uses a simple http REST API whereby calls to go the following address on port 443 (https):
  https://txn.paywith.glass
  
All calls are prefixed with the following php POST/GET parameters:
  v=$VENDOR_DOMAIN_NAME
  cc=$VENDOR_COUNTRY_ID
  o=$USER_ID_HASH
  
  eg - https://txn.paywith.glass/?v=$VENDOR_DOMAIN_NAME&cc=$VENDOR_COUNTRY_ID&o=$USER_ID_HASH

All calls must include identification of:
    1. The vendor via a unique domain name "$VENDOR_DOMAIN_NAME" (default is paywith.glass/smdwireless.com)
    2. The country code of the vendor under which the account falls "$VENDOR_COUNTRY_ID" (default is uk-uk,+00/amsterdam-nl,+02)
    3. The user account that is accessing the service under that vendor identified by PHP Session ID "$USER_ID_HASH".

User identification will be achieved via our looking.glass authentication infrastructure which defines these rules in way that
has already been standardized across our entire ecosystem. looking.glass authentication relies on the user's php session id and
a failure to present recognizable inputs for any of the above will result in a 301 redirection to https://paywith.glass and exit.

If a user connects to the service with session ID that is recognized as being owned by a guest user, the default action is
the return the looking.glass login form.
