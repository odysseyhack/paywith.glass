Public api calls go the following https address on port 443, where they are prefixed as:
  https://txn.paywith.glass/?v=$VENDOR_DOMAIN_NAME&cc=$VENDOR_COUNTRY_ID&o=$USER_ID_HASH

All API calls must include identification of:
    1. The vendor via a unique domain name "$VENDOR_DOMAIN_NAME" (default is paywith.glass/smdwireless.com)
    2. The country code of the vendor under which the account falls "$VENDOR_COUNTRY_ID" (default is uk-uk,+00/amsterdam-nl,+02)
    3. The user account that is accessing the service under that vendor identified by PHP Session ID "$USER_ID_HASH".

User identification will be achieved via our looking.glass authentication infrastructure which defines these rules in way that has already been standardized across our entire ecosystem. looking.glass authentication relies on the user's php session id and a failure to present recognizable inputs for any of the above will result in a 301 redirection to https://paywith.glass and exit.

If a user connects to the service with session ID that is recognized as being owned by a guest user, the default action is the return the looking.glass login form.
