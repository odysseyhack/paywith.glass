1. define list of endpoints and supported operations
2. Implement call / business logic of rest service to core system
3. look into swagger php docs?
4. start with vendordomainname, vendorcountryid and useridhash as Q params but if theres time look into moving those as header parameters to get a cleaner API.

5.Setup jenkins?
